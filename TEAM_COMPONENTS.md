# Team Components Added ✅

## What's Been Created

I've added **TWO team section styles** that match your Augment theme:

### 1. **TeamSection** (`components/ui/team.tsx`)
- **Location**: `/components/ui/team.tsx` (shadcn-style structure)
- **Style**: Grid layout with circular avatars
- **Features**:
  - 2-column mobile, 4-column desktop
  - Hover effects with social links (LinkedIn, Twitter)
  - Border changes to **#D6FD3A** on hover
  - Multiple team categories (Leadership, Faculty)
  - Shadow effects
  - Framer Motion animations

### 2. **TeamShowcase** (`components/TeamShowcase.tsx`)
- **Location**: `/components/TeamShowcase.tsx`
- **Style**: Full-size card layout with image zoom
- **Features**:
  - Grayscale to color on hover
  - Image scale animation
  - Tracking-wide text effect
  - Slide-up role reveal
  - Profile links
  - 3-column grid on desktop

## 🎨 Theme Integration

Both components use your Augment brand colors:
- ✅ **#D6FD3A** - Accent color (hover states, links)
- ✅ **Black** - Primary text and backgrounds
- ✅ **White** - Card backgrounds
- ✅ **Gray-50** - Section backgrounds

## 📦 Current Setup

Already added to your main page:
```tsx
<Faculty />          ← Original instructor cards
<TeamSection />      ← Compact team grid (shadcn style)
<TeamShowcase />     ← Full showcase cards
<Testimonials />     ← Student testimonials
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Update Team Members

Edit the data in each component:

**`components/ui/team.tsx`:**
```tsx
const leadership = [
  {
    name: 'Your Name',
    role: 'Your Role',
    avatar: 'https://your-image-url.jpg',
    social: { linkedin: '#', twitter: '#' }
  }
]
```

**`components/TeamShowcase.tsx`:**
```tsx
const members = [
  {
    name: 'Team Member',
    role: 'Position',
    avatar: 'https://image-url.jpg',
    link: '#profile-link'
  }
]
```

### Use Real Images

Replace Unsplash URLs with actual team photos:
```tsx
avatar: '/images/team/jordan-peterson.jpg'
```

### Remove a Section

If you only want one team style, remove from `app/page.tsx`:
```tsx
// Remove this line:
<TeamSection />
// or this one:
<TeamShowcase />
```
